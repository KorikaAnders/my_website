    <h1>Welcome to the website about designing websites.</h1>
        
        <main>
            <p>
                The subject of this website is subject to change based off my whims and whether or not I have a psychology paper due in less than a week
                please take the time to enjoy that this site is about the idea of designing websites for now, and be excited for other future topics
            </p>

            <h2>A list of Future Topics This Website Could Be About!!</h2> <!--this is a header 2, it's smaller than header 1 -->
            <ul>   
                <li>Foxes and the things I think could be pretty if they had foxes in them</li>
                <li>Elbows, boring, or future transgressive trend?</li>
                <li>What's the deal with LED Headlights on the Road?</li>

                <li>Why AI totally isn't a bubble this time, seriously guys I just need another 6 billion dollars and it'll work I swear</li>

            <p>But the web could look like that again. Do you remember when the web was beautiful and amazing? Before Silicon Valley&copy; sanitized and corpatized it?
            We could go back! We must return.
            </p> 
            <!--I'm genuinely actually serious about this. I hate modern web design principles. I hate Corporate Memphis. I just want the web to a unique
            and beautiful jungle again, instead of a shitty HOA Walled Garden with 10 billion cameras pointed at it's visitors -->
